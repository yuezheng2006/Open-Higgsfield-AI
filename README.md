| Linux (Ubuntu x64) | See [v1.0.6 release](https://github.com/Anil-matcha/Open-Generative-AI/releases/tag/v1.0.6) for `.AppImage` and `.deb`, or build locally with `npm run electron:build:linux`. |

All releases: [github.com/Anil-matcha/Open-Generative-AI/releases](https://github.com/Anil-matcha/Open-Generative-AI/releases)

### macOS Installation Guide

Because the app is not notarized by Apple, macOS Gatekeeper will block it on first launch. Follow these steps:

**Step 1** — Mount the DMG and drag the app to `/Applications`

**Step 2** — Open Terminal and run:
```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/Open Generative AI.app"
```

**Step 3** — Right-click the app in `/Applications` → click **Open** → click **Open** again on the dialog

> You only need to do this once. After that, the app opens normally.

**Alternative (no Terminal):**
1. Try to open the app — macOS will block it
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**
3. Scroll down to find _"Open Generative AI was blocked"_
4. Click **Open Anyway** → **Open**

### Windows Installation — SmartScreen warning fix

Windows SmartScreen may show a warning because the installer is not code-signed:

1. Click **More info** on the SmartScreen dialog
2. Click **Run anyway**

The app will install silently to `%LocalAppData%` with a Start Menu shortcut.

### Ubuntu / Linux Installation

Linux artifacts are available when building with Electron Builder:

```bash
# Build Linux installers (AppImage + .deb)
npm run electron:build:linux
```

Generated files are written to the `release/` folder:
- **AppImage** — portable, run directly after making executable:
  ```bash
  chmod +x "release/Open Generative AI-*.AppImage"
  ./release/Open\ Generative\ AI-*.AppImage
  ```
- **.deb** — install on Debian/Ubuntu:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install ./release/open-generative-ai_*_amd64.deb
  ```

If AppImage fails to start on older systems, install `libfuse2`:

```bash
sudo apt install libfuse2
```

#### Ubuntu 24.04+ / AppArmor sandbox restriction

Ubuntu 24.04 and later enable a kernel security policy (`apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`) that blocks Chromium's user-namespace sandbox. If the app fails to start silently or crashes immediately, you have two options:

**Option A — Recommended: install the `.deb` instead.**
The `.deb` package ships an AppArmor profile that grants the required permission automatically on install with no system-wide changes.

**Option B — Temporary system fix (AppImage users):**
```bash
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0
```
This lasts until next reboot. To make it permanent:
```bash
echo 'kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-userns.conf
```

## ⚡ Local Model Inference (Desktop App Only)

The desktop app supports **two independent local engines**. Pick whichever fits the machine you actually run on:

| Engine | What it is | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **sd.cpp** (bundled) | C++ engine from [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp), runs on the same machine as the app. Metal GPU on Apple Silicon, CUDA/Vulkan/ROCm on Linux/Windows. | Image-only models. Works on Mac M-series. |
| **Wan2GP** (BYO server) | HTTP client to a user-run [Wan2GP](https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP) server. The server runs Python + PyTorch on a CUDA/ROCm GPU; the desktop app only sends prompts and receives results. | Video models (Wan 2.2, Hunyuan, LTX) and large image models (Flux, Qwen-Image). NVIDIA/AMD GPU required on the *server*; the desktop app itself can run on a Mac. |

Both engines share the same UI: open **Settings → Local Models** to configure each.

### Engine 1 — sd.cpp (bundled)

| Model | Type | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Z-Image Turbo** ⚡ | Diffusion Transformer | 2.5 GB + 2.7 GB aux | 8-step turbo. Heavy on memory. |
| **Z-Image Base** ⚡ | Diffusion Transformer | 3.5 GB + 2.7 GB aux | 50-step high-quality. Heavy on memory. |
| **Dreamshaper 8** | SD 1.5 | 2.1 GB | 20-step versatile. Lightest tested option on Mac. |
| **Realistic Vision v5.1** | SD 1.5 | 2.1 GB | 25-step photorealistic |
| **Anything v5** | SD 1.5 | 2.1 GB | 20-step anime/illustration |
| **SDXL Base 1.0** | SDXL | 6.9 GB | 30-step high-res |

> **Z-Image models** require two shared auxiliary files (downloaded once, shared across both models):
> - **Qwen3-4B Text Encoder** — 2.4 GB
> - **FLUX VAE** — 335 MB

**How to use:**
1. Open **Settings → Local Models** in the desktop app
2. Install the **sd.cpp inference engine** (one click — auto-downloaded)
3. Download your chosen model (and auxiliary files for Z-Image)
4. In **Image Studio**, click the **⚡ Local** toggle next to the model selector
5. Select your local model and generate — no API key needed

All downloads happen inside the app. Nothing is installed system-wide.

### Engine 2 — Wan2GP (remote Gradio server)

The app does **not** bundle Python or model weights for Wan2GP. You run Wan2GP yourself on a machine with a CUDA or ROCm GPU and point the desktop app at its URL.

```bash
# On your GPU machine
git clone https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP
cd Wan2GP
./install.sh                          # or install.bat on Windows
python wgp.py --listen --server-name 0.0.0.0   # binds to all interfaces
```

Then in the desktop app: **Settings → Local Models → Wan2GP server**, paste the URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:7860`), click **Test**, then **Save**. The Wan2GP models become available — image models in **Image Studio**, video models reachable via the same generation API (Image Studio rejects video output explicitly; full Video Studio wiring is on the roadmap).

| Model | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Flux.1 Dev** | Image | 1024px, 28 steps |
| **Qwen Image** | Image | 1024px, 30 steps |
| **Wan 2.2 (T2V / I2V)** | Video | Slow on consumer GPUs |
| **Hunyuan Video** | Video | High-quality T2V |
| **LTX Video** | Video | Fastest video option |

> **Why a separate server?** Wan2GP's runtime (Sage attention, flash-attn, AWQ/GGUF kernels) is CUDA-only — there is no MPS / Apple Silicon path. Treating it as a remote server lets a Mac-only user keep the desktop app while offloading inference to a Linux/Windows GPU box, a gaming PC on the LAN, or a rented RunPod/vast.ai instance.

> **Local inference is only available in the desktop app.** The hosted web version always uses cloud APIs.

### Hardware Notes

- **sd.cpp** runs on CPU (all platforms) and **Metal GPU** on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4); CUDA/Vulkan/ROCm on Linux/Windows.
- Metal GPU acceleration is built into the macOS desktop binary — significantly faster than CPU-only.
- Recommended for sd.cpp Z-Image: 16 GB RAM (7.4 GB weights + 2.4 GB compute buffer). On a base 8 GB M-series Mac, **Z-Image is known to hang the system** — stick to SD 1.5 there.
- For SD 1.5 on M2: expect ~1–2 s/step with the Metal dylib active. If you see ~10 s/step instead, the binary may have fallen back to CPU — see verification below.

### Verifying the SD 1.5 path (the fastest sanity test on Mac)

If you want to confirm sd.cpp is installed correctly without going through the UI, you can drive `sd-cli` directly. This is the same binary the app uses.

```bash
# 1. App data layout (created on first app launch)
APP_DATA="$HOME/Library/Application Support/open-generative-ai/local-ai"
ls "$APP_DATA/bin"     # sd-cli, libstable-diffusion.dylib
ls "$APP_DATA/models"  # whatever you've downloaded

# 2. Grab a small SD 1.5 model directly (Dreamshaper 8, ~2 GB)
curl -L --fail --progress-bar \
  -o "$APP_DATA/models/DreamShaper_8_pruned.safetensors" \
  "https://huggingface.co/Lykon/DreamShaper/resolve/main/DreamShaper_8_pruned.safetensors"

# 3. Run a single 512x512 / 12-step inference
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="$APP_DATA/bin" "$APP_DATA/bin/sd-cli" \
  -m "$APP_DATA/models/DreamShaper_8_pruned.safetensors" \
  -p "a serene mountain lake at sunrise, oil painting" \
  -o /tmp/sd15-test.png \
  --steps 12 -H 512 -W 512 --cfg-scale 7.5 --seed 42 \
  --sampling-method euler_a
```

A healthy run on Apple Silicon prints `total params memory size = 1969.78MB (VRAM 1969.78MB, RAM 0.00MB)` (Metal-backed) and produces a coherent 512×512 PNG. If `VRAM` is `0.00MB` instead, the dylib is CPU-only — check `otool -L "$APP_DATA/bin/libstable-diffusion.dylib" | grep -i metal` and reinstall the engine from **Settings → Local Models** if Metal is missing.

The `packages/studio` library is also consumed by the hosted version on [muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) — model updates made in `packages/studio/src/models.js` apply to both the self-hosted app and the hosted version automatically.

## 🔌 API Integration

The app communicates with [Muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) using a two-step pattern:

1. **Submit** — `POST /api/v1/{model-endpoint}` with prompt and parameters
2. **Poll** — `GET /api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result` until status is `completed`

Authentication uses the `x-api-key` header. During development, a Vite proxy handles CORS by routing `/api` requests to `https://api.muapi.ai`.

File uploads use `POST /api/v1/upload_file` (multipart/form-data) and return a hosted URL that is passed to image-conditioned models. For multi-image models the full `images_list` array is forwarded to the API in one request.

Lip sync jobs use the same two-step pattern: a dedicated `processLipSync()` method accepts `image_url` or `video_url` alongside `audio_url`, dispatches to the model's endpoint, and polls until the output video URL is available.
